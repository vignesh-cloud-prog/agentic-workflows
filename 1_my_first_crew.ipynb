Define an Agent with a role, goal, and the LLM model it will use.\n","2. Define a Task that associates a description and expected output to the agent.\n","3. Initialize a Crew with the agent and task.\n","4. Kickoff the Crew with an input query and observe the response.\n","\n","---\n","### Prerequisites\n","- Install the `crewai` library.\n","- Obtain API keys for the LLM model you want to use (e.g.,
